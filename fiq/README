This is a bare metal code sample on Fast Models 9.1 with Cortex A15x1 to test the FIQ (not IRQ) timer interrupt.

To run Fast Models with the program, run:
make
sh run.sh

For any question, please contact Dongli Zhang (dongli.zhang0129@gmail.com)


TrustZone non-secure (normal world) interrupt is always signaled as FIQ.
The base address of GIC Distributor is 0x2c001000.
The base address of GIC Interface is 0x2c002000.
ICCICR Interface Control Register (banked) is at offset 0x0

[0] ENABLES  enable secure interrupt
[1] ENABLENS enable non-secure interrupt
[3] FIQEn 1-signal secure interrupt as FIQ, 0-IRQ. non-secure interrupt is always IRQ
